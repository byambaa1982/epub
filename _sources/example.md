Audience Description
The Databricks Certified Data Engineer Associate certification exam assesses an individual’s ability
to use the Databricks Lakehouse Platform to complete introductory data engineering tasks. This
includes an understanding of the Lakehouse Platform and its workspace, its architecture, and its
capabilities. It also assesses the ability to perform multi-hop architecture ETL tasks using Apache
Spark SQL and Python in both batch and incrementally processed paradigms. Finally, the exam
assesses the tester’s ability to put basic ETL pipelines and Databricks SQL queries and dashboards
into production while maintaining entity permissions. Individuals who pass this certification exam
can be expected to complete basic data engineering tasks using Databricks and its associated
tools.


Section 4: Production Pipelines
- Identify the benefits of using multiple tasks in Jobs.
-  Set up a predecessor task in Jobs.
- Identify a scenario in which a predecessor task should be set up.
-  Review a task's execution history.
-  Identify CRON as a scheduling opportunity.
-  Debug a failed task.
- Set up a retry policy in case of failure.
- Create an alert in the case of a failed task.
- Identify that an alert can be sent via email.

Let's refine the memory trick by listing key words for each point and updating the mnemonic story to make it even more memorable. Here are the key words:

- Benefits - Multiple Tasks
- Predecessor - Setup
- Scenario - Predecessor Needed
- Review - Execution History
- CRON - Scheduling
- Debug - Failed Task
- Retry - Policy
- Alert - Creation
- Email - Alert Notification
- Using these keywords, let's update our mnemonic story:

Imagine you're the chief engineer (Benefits) in a futuristic city where tasks are completed by robots. Your first job is to assemble a team of robots (Multiple Tasks) to work more efficiently together.

You decide to build a master robot (Predecessor), which is essential for coordinating the other robots' tasks efficiently. This robot is designed to activate (Setup) only when certain conditions are met in the city (Scenario), like directing traffic during rush hour or managing power during a surge.

To ensure everything runs smoothly, you frequently check the control panel (Review) to observe each robot's activity log (Execution History). You program a special timer (CRON) into the system to automate tasks based on specific timings throughout the day, optimizing the city's workflow (Scheduling).

Despite your careful planning, a robot malfunctions (Debug), causing a minor disruption. You meticulously examine the code and machinery to find the error and fix the problem (Failed Task).

Learning from this incident, you implement a system where robots automatically try to correct their own errors before stopping their tasks (Retry). This policy ensures the city keeps running smoothly, even when you're not directly overseeing operations.

To keep yourself informed, you set up a central alarm system (Alert) that activates whenever a problem arises, immediately drawing your attention to the issue at hand.

Finally, you ensure that if you're away from the control center, you'll receive a notification on your personal communicator (Email), keeping you updated about the city's operational status no matter where you are.

This story, with its focus on a futuristic city and its robotic workforce, creates a vivid narrative around the key points of "Section 4: Production Pipelines," helping you to remember each step through the imagery and actions described.
